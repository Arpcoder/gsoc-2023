# Hey there
We're very happy that you consider contributing to our projects during Google Summer of Code 2023.

- Please inform yourself on the available projects in the Issues section of this repo. https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/gsoc-2023


- Please provide a brief CV.
- In your application please include answers to the following questions:
 [] What interests you most about this project?
 [] As mentors and project coordinators, how can we get the best out of you?
 [] Is there anything that you’ll be studying or working on whilst working alongside us?
 [] We'd love to hear a bit on your work preferences, e.g. how you keep yourself organized, what tools you use, etc?
 [] Once you’ve selected a project assignment from the ideas page, please suggest a weekly schedule with clear milestones and deliverables around it. Alternatively, if you want to propose your own idea then please include outline, goals, and a well-defined weekly schedule with clear milestones and deliverables.

Please complete a matching mandatory qualification task on the idea page (also linked to with every idea/task on the idea page) when you apply. When applying with your own idea please check with the mentors/org admins beforehand to see which qualification task would be a good match. Applications without completed qualification task will not be considered."
